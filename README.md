This is my portfolio assignment for CISC 480: Senior Capstone. I decided to turn this assignment into a site so I could also demonstrate some of the skills I have learned during my time at the University of St. Thomas. The first page is index.html. This is an introduction to the site and a brief introduction about me. There are 3 linked projects on the top of the page that individually explain the project and display an image. Another feature of this site is thta it is also mobile-view friendly. Here is a brief description for each of the 3 projects linked on this page:

Project 1 is a project I worked on during my time at Best Buy this past summer. I got to meet with different teams and hear different risks a company may face in a given year.

Project 2 is a personal site I created in my Web Development class to introduce the visitor to me, my interests, experiences, and past projects. 

Project 3 is another assignment that was done in my Web Development class. My group and I created worked on a Dynamic Web Server assignment regarding the energy uses of each state form the years 1960-2018.
