                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This is an analysis of 3 interesting facts I found while working with the data and my predictions for
                    the future regarding <a href="Project3.html" target="_self">Project 3</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In 1985, Colorado had negative value for Nuclear Energy (This was due to the state producing
                        more than it used)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The numbers for petroleum in Hawaii are very high.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The usage of Nuclear Energy grew exponentially after the 1960s, before there was little to none
                        reported.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Analysis:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>After completing the project and checking the data, I was shocked by the surge in usage for all 5
                    types of energy in the database. Seeing how much each state
                    relies on these resources really made me think about what would happen if access to one or more was
                    lost.
                    Thankfully, usage of renewable energy has been growing as time progresses too. Something I would
                    like to see in the future is how these numbers have changed due to the pandemic. Like many other
                    areas, I am sure many of the numbers have changed drastically since the start of the pandemic, most
                    likely for the worse. Another area I believe has changed as a result of the pandemic is
                    sustainability. Just like the numbers for energy potentially changing for the worse, the
                    strive for sustainability in all aspects of our lives has changed. The University of St. Thomas is
                    committed to making sustainability the heart of its mission. As a student, I have seen firsthand
                    that
                    the pandemic has not slowed them down from achieving this mission. This university has shown that
                    even
                    during unprecedented times, they are adaptable and have moved forward in their progression.</p>
