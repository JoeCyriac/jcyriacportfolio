                <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
                <br>
                <p>Frome June 2021 - August 2021, I worked at Best Buy as an Information Security Risk Analyst.
                    My big project for the summer was to meet with different teams in risk management to analyze
                    and discuss all the threats
                    a team might see in a given year, how much each threat may cost the company, and come up
                    with ways to combat these
                    threats. I had a chance to work with several leaders in Risk Management and the VP of
                    Information Security.
                    It was amazing being able to see the perspective of Information Security in the eyes of one
                    of the most popular technological retailers.
                    There were procedures and a team to respond to every issue and I was impressed by how big
                    the entire team was.
                    After conducting over 15 meetings, I passed the information to another team that was able to
                    put
                    the risks discussed into a dollar amount and rank them by severity.</p>
                <br>
