                <h3><b>About Me:</b></h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Joseph Cyriac, but I prefer to go by Joe. I am currently a senior at the
                    University of St. Thomas. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Applied
                    Statistics. Linked above are 3 projects that I am proud to be able to say I have had the
                    oppurtunity to work on.
                    I believe all 3 projects not only display the caliber of work I am able to complete, but
                    also my interests. These projects blend everything I have learned at St. Thomas and have
                    opened my eyes to
                    the type of work I would like to do after graduating. Project 1 is something I worked on
                    during my time at Best Buy this past summer.
                    Project 2 is a personal site I created in my Web Development class to introduce the visitor
                    to me, my interests, experiences, and past projects. Project 3 is a Dynamic Web Server
                    assignment done in my
                    Web development class regarding the energy uses of each state form the years 1960-2018.

                    After graduating in May 2022, I hope to start a challenging position that allows
                    me to utilize my technological skills, creativity, talents, and interpersonal skills to help
                    the organization meet its goals and provide me with the opportunity for growth.
